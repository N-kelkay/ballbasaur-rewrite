HEY FUTURE SELF,

YOU ARE PROBABLY SEEING THIS BECAUSE YOU FINISHED EVERYTHING AND YOU
ARE LOOKING FOR STUFF TO IMPROVE ON. HERE IS A LIST OF THINGS TO DO:

- PROPERLY ORGANIZE THE BRANCH

- SIMPLIFY EVERYTHING (I KNOW YOU DIDN'T...)

- RE-RUN EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE IT IS PROPERLY WORKING (AGAIN!)

- SIMPLIFY EVERYTHING (I KNOW YOU STILL HAVEN'T...)

- GET NOAH TO RE-CHECK EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE IT IS PROPERLY WORKING

- I SAID SIMPLIFY EVERYTHING!!!!! (JUST DOOOOO IT!!!!!)

SINCERELY,
YOU FROM THE PAST
